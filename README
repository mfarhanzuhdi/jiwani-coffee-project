# Jiwani Coffee - Cashless Ordering and Payment System

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive system for Jiwani Coffee that enables customers to browse menus, place orders, and make cashless payments using QR codes. The system consists of three main components that work together seamlessly:

1. **Mobile Application**  
   A React Native app for customers to order and pay via their smartphones.

2. **Backend Services**  
   APIs and databases built with Node.js and MySQL to manage orders, users, payments, and balances.

3. **Web Application and Admin Panel**  
   A web-based interface for both customers and administrators, handling ordering, user management, and transaction tracking.

## Repository Structure
The project is divided into three repositories, each focusing on one component:

- [Mobile App Repository](https://github.com/username/android)  
- [Backend Repository](https://github.com/username/backend)  
- [Web App Repository](https://github.com/username/webserver)

## How They Work Together
- The mobile app communicates with the backend APIs to fetch menus and send orders.  
- The web app provides an alternative frontend and administrative functions, also connected to the backend.  
- Payment is handled through integrated Midtrans API for QR code-based cashless transactions.

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as the central overview and documentation point for the entire project. It helps reviewers and team members understand the project scope, components, and relationships between repositories.
